The aerial digital canvas is a vision based approach that allows users to draw in air and transform the motion into digital art. It provides interactive and touchfree experience for teaching without any traditional tools.

The system leverages mediapipe and opencv to track hands in real time. The system is integrated with the features like Virtual keyboard, smart shape suggester and also handwritten mathematical equations solver.

We have trained two CNN models to identify mathematical symbols and to detect hand drawn shapes. Our system gives 99.12% accuracy for shape suggester while for HME it gives 97.07% accuracy.
